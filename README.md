## prompt organizing tool
Prompt Wisp is a specialized tool for managing, organizing, and sharing AI prompts. Born out of the need to organize and share my own scattered prompts, prompt wisp aims to be the go to solution for prompt engineers, content creators, and AI users overall.

## main features (in progress)
- **Centralized prompt database**: Store all your prompts in one organized location
- **Custom collections and tags**: Organize prompts your way
- **Seamless sharing**: Share your best prompts with the community, easier than never
- **Browser extension**: Access all your prompts without having to switch tabs
- **Version control**: Track changes to your prompts over time

## vision
Prompt Wisp is being developed as a complete app split in 3:
1. **Core Backend**: Robust API and database for managing prompts
2. **Web Application**: User-friendly interface for organizing and discovering prompts
3. **Browser Extension**: Quick access to your prompts directly in AI tools and platforms

## more about this project
Prompt Wisp is being developed as part of my journey in [Hack Club's Neighbourhood](https://neighborhood.hackclub.com/) program. The project emerged from my personal struggle with managing specialized prompts across various platforms and wanting to create a solution that would benefit both myself and the community of AI prompt engineers and users.

## current status
currently building: backend and db connection

This project is under active development. Follow along as i finish the backend and expand the features!
